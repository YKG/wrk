Additional notes for the Windows OS Internals Curriculum Resource Kit (CRK) Instructor Supplement:

The student lab manual PDF file is a direct print from Powerpoint selecting the NOTES page output. So, if you customize the lab manual and want to re-create the lab manual PDF, choose File->Print in Powerpoint and in the "Print What" list box choose Notes pages (not slides, handouts, or outline view).

Since the answers to quiz questions in the quiz Powerpoint files are in the notes page, to reprint the quiz, choose "Slides" or "Handouts" from the "Print What" list box in the Powerpoint print dialog.
